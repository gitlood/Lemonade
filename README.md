You're going to help us bring our vision of making digital lemonade to life! The goal is to create a simple, interactive app that lets you juice lemons when you tap the image on screen until you have a glass of lemonade. Consider it a metaphor or maybe just a fun way to pass the time!

Four phone screenshots are shown in a horizontal row labeled from 1 through 4. The first screenshot shows an image of a lemon tree in the center of the screen with a text label that says, "Tap the lemon tree to select a lemon." The second screenshot shows an image of a lemon in the center of the screen with a text label that says, "Keep tapping the lemon to squeeze it." The third screenshot shows an image of a glass of lemonade in the center of it with a text label that says, "Tap the lemonade to drink it." The fourth screenshot shows an image of an empty glass with a text label that says, "Tap the empty glass to start again." There's an arrow that points from the first screenshot to the second screenshot, an arrow that points from the second screenshot to the third screenshot, an arrow that points from the third screenshot to the fourth screenshot, and an arrow from the fourth screenshot back to the first screenshot. There's also an arrow from the second screenshot with the lemon image back to itself with a text label that says, "Random number of times."

Here's how the app works:

When the user first launches the app, they see a lemon tree. There's a label that prompts them to tap the lemon tree image to "select" a lemon from the tree.
After they tap the lemon tree, the user sees a lemon. They are prompted to tap the lemon to "squeeze" it to make lemonade. They need to tap the lemon several times to squeeze it. The number of taps required to squeeze the lemon is different each time and is a randomly generated number between 2 to 4 (inclusive).
After they've tapped the lemon the required number of times, they see a refreshing glass of lemonade! They are asked to tap the glass to "drink" the lemonade.
After they tap the lemonade glass, they see an empty glass. They are asked to tap the empty glass to start again.
After they tap the empty glass, they see the lemon tree and can begin the process again. More lemonade please!

For each step of making lemonade, there's a different image and text label on the screen, and different behavior for how the app responds to a click. For example, when the user taps the lemon tree, the app shows a lemon.

Your job is to build the app's UI layout and implement the logic for the user to move through all the steps to make lemonade.
